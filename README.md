# TypeScript Exercises - Part 9

This repository contains exercises from part 9 of the course on TypeScript. The `myApp` folder contains the exercises from the `courseParts` project.

## Topics Covered

In this section, we studied the following aspects of TypeScript:

- Giving types to function parameters and variables.
- Writing type guards to ensure and narrow down the type of variables. This is especially important when dealing with data from sources like `request.body`, which may not have defined types.
